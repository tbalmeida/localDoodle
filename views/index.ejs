<h1>Welcome to Schoodle!</h1>
<small class="text-muted">Doodle's based project for educational purposes.</small>
<p><br></p>
<p>We are the neighborhood friendly way to schedule a meeting with your friends, providing them with options
  of dates and time to choose from.
  <br>There is no need to register or pay for anything. Just create a proposal and send them a link to the
  page for your event and you're set to go!
</p>
<p>Schoodle is a midterm project for the Lighthouse Lab's Web Development Bootcamp, 2020-Jan Calgary Cohort.</p>

<p><br>We just need your email to get you started!</p>
